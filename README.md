# Personalized Contrastive Learning for Dysarthric Keyword Recognition

This Repository contains code files for my Final Project for my Spring 2025 Class at Tufts University, SP25-DATA-0297: Deep Learning for Multimodal AI.

The code contained in this repository was run on Google Colab, and intended to be run in the order specified by each Jupyter Notebook File.

The raw data used for this project, Hugginface's abnerh/TORGO-database, was processed and stored for use in the succeeding notebooks.
